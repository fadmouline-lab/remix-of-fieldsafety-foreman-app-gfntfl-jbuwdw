Project Setup and Navigation:**\n\n*   Set up the basic React Native project structure with Expo.\n*   Implement navigation between the Login, Forgot Password, Select Project, and Home screens using React Navigation.\n\n**2. Login Screen:**\n\n*   Create a centered login screen with the app title \"FieldSafety Pro\" at the top.\n*   Implement a card-style area with \"Welcome Back\" title, Email and Password text fields (with eye icon for password visibility), a \"Sign In\" button that navigates to the Select Project screen, and a \"Forgot Password?\" link that opens the Forgot Password screen.\n\n**3. Forgot Password Screen:**\n\n*   Create a simple screen with the text \"Having trouble logging in? Call your manager to reset your password.\" and a placeholder manager contact.\n*   Add a back button to navigate back to the Login screen.\n\n**4. Select Project Screen:**\n\n*   Create a screen with the title \"Select Project\" and subtitle \"Where are you working today?\".\n*   Implement a scrollable list of project cards with placeholder data for project name, address, \"Project Manager\" chip, and status pill (\"Live\" or \"Completed\").\n*   Tapping a project card will navigate to the Home screen.\n*   Use the exact project items you provided.\n\n**5. Home Screen (Dashboard with Two Tabs):**\n\n*   Implement a tabbed interface with \"TO-DO\" (default) and \"MORE FORMS\" tabs.\n*   Top area displays the large project name (placeholder) and contact line.\n*   **TO-DO Tab:**\n    *   \"TODAY\" section with three vertical cards: \"DAILY PRE-TASK CHECKLIST\", \"TIME-CARDS\", \"DAILY ACTIVITY LOG\" (each with a + icon).\n    *   \"Completed Forms\" section with gray placeholder cards for completed forms (with \"Submitted on: May 4th 2023\" subtitle and \"EDIT\" button).\n*   **MORE FORMS Tab:**\n    *   \"Manage Job-Site\" section with cards: \"EXTRA WORK TICKETS\", \"HAULING DUMPSTERS\" (each with a + icon).\n    *   \"Safety\" section with cards: \"EQUIPMENT INSPECTION\", \"OBSERVATION\", \"NEAR MISS\", \"INCIDENT\" (each with a + icon).\n    *   Bottom of the tab: \"Completed Forms\" with gray placeholder cards and \"EDIT\" buttons.\n\n**6.

The code appears to be correctly initializing the Supabase client using `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js`. It also configures the client to persist sessions using `AsyncStorage`.\n\nBased on the error message \"Cannot destructure property 'SupabaseClient' of 'main.default' as it is undefined,\" the problem is likely not in this file itself, but rather in how this file is being imported and used in other parts of the application. The error suggests that when you're trying to import something from `app/integrations/supabase/client.ts`, the module is not exporting a `SupabaseClient` property directly. Instead, it exports `supabase`.\n\nHere's what you should check:\n\n1.  **Import Statements:** In the files where you're using the Supabase client, make sure you're importing it correctly.  You should be importing `supabase` (the instance created in `client.ts`), not trying to import `SupabaseClient` directly.  The correct import statement should look like this:\n\n    ```javascript\n    import { supabase } from \"@/integrations/supabase/client\";\n    ```\n\n2.  **Usage:**  After importing `supabase`, you should use it directly to interact with your Supabase database.  For example:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const { data, error } = await supabase\n      .from('your_table')\n      .select('*');\n    ```\n\n**To directly answer your questions:**\n\n*   **\"Is that because the code is trying to Automatically connect to Supabase in the backend and failing?\"**  No, the code you've shown doesn't imply any automatic backend connection. The Supabase client is initialized in the frontend and will attempt to connect when you make requests using it. The error is happening during the import/initialization phase, not necessarily during a connection attempt.\n*   **\"Which direction should we move towards? Trying to connect right now?\"** Focus on fixing the import statements and ensuring you're using the `supabase` instance correctly. Once the import error is resolved, you can proceed with testing the connection and querying your database.\n*   **\"Can we still make edits in the frontend without this error and connect later?\"** Yes, you can continue making frontend edits as long as you avoid using the incorrect import or any Supabase-related code that's causing the error. Use conditional checks or placeholder data as needed.\n\nIn summary, the key is to correct the import statements to use the exported `supabase` instance from `app/integrations/supabase/client.ts`.\n"}], "timestamp": "2025-12-15T17:31:01Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "\n\nUpdate my existing project. I already have these screens: **Login**, **Forgot Password**, **Select Project**, and **Home (Dashboard with TO-DO / MORE FORMS tabs)**.\n\nI want to:\n\n1. Add a **Settings menu** on the Home/Dashboard screen.\n2. Create a new **Profile** screen.\n3. Add **back arrows** on Forgot Password and Select Project.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Settings on Home (Dashboard)\n\nOn the Home screen, add a small **settings icon** in the top-right corner (you can use a cog or three vertical dots). When tapped, open a **modal panel or dropdown** anchored to the top-right. The settings menu should include:\n\n* **\u201cSelect Project\u201d** \u2192 closes the menu and navigates to the **Select Project** screen.\n* **\u201cProfile\u201d** \u2192 closes the menu and navigates to the new **Profile** screen.\n* **Language toggle**: show a row with label **\u201cLanguage\u201d** and a switch / segmented control: **English | Espa\u00f1ol**.\n\nStore the current language in some global state or context (no backend). When the user switches language, immediately update at least the main labels on the Home screen for both tabs. For example:\n\n* \u201cTO-DO\u201d \u2194 \u201cPOR HACER\u201d\n* \u201cMORE FORMS\u201d \u2194 \u201cM\u00c1S FORMULARIOS\u201d\n* \u201cTODAY\u201d \u2194 \u201cHOY\u201d\n* \u201cClosed Forms\u201d \u2194 \u201cFormularios Cerrados\u201d\n* \u201cCompleted Forms\u201d \u2194 \u201cFormularios Completados\u201d\n\nFinally, add a **Log Out** item at the bottom of this menu, styled in red. Tapping \u201cLog Out\u201d should clear any in-memory user state and navigate back to the **Login** screen. Include a small **X / Close** icon at the top of the menu to dismiss it without navigating.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

For now, everything is static front-end placeholder data.\n\nAt the bottom, include a neutral button **\u201cBack to Dashboard\u201d** that also returns to Home.\n\nThis screen should also respect the current language state so labels (Name, Company, Role, etc.) are translated when the user switches languages from the settings menu.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Back navigation on existing screens\n\nUpdate these screens to ensure users can always return:\n\n* **Forgot Password**: add a top bar with a **back arrow** on the left that navigates back to the **Login** screen.\n* **Select Project**: ensure there is a **back arrow** at the top-left that navigates back to **Login** (not to Home).\n\nKeep all navigation purely front-end; no backend calls yet.
